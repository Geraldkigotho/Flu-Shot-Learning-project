    "**1.1: OVERVIEW**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaccines play a very crucial role in disease prevention,they work by providing immunity to individuals as well communities to prevent certain communicable diseases like COVID-19,swine flu,seasonal flu and Tuberculosis.The first vaccine was developed in 1796,by a English physician Edward Jenner and was used to vaccinate the first human aganist smallpox.Today's vaccines have evolved and become more complex,robust and more efficient these is due to the continous growth of technology and research in the health industry.The H1N1 VACCINE was developed in 2009 and approved for use in 2010 these  is after the swineflue pandemic  broke out in 2009 killing more than two million people worldwide while the seasonal vaccine also known as the flu-shot is commonly used to prevent flu (common cold) during the flu season.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central disease center(CDC) want to understand how different  individual personal characterstics influence the uptake of the H1N1 ans seasonal vaccine as well as the vaccine patterns which would  provide guidance for future public health efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.2:CHALLENGES**\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of adequate data driven decisions in provision of H1N1 and seasonal vaccines to the population\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.3:PROPOSED SOLUTION**\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine learning model which will predict the uptake of the H1N1 and seasonal vaccines based on there own personal characteristics with \"Area under the ROC Curve of 80%\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.4:BRIEF CCONCLUSION**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaccines are crucial for disease prevention, protecting individuals and communities against diseases like COVID-19 and tuberculosis. The CDC is exploring how personal traits affect vaccine uptake, proposing a machine learning model with 80% ROC curve accuracy to predict H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccine uptake based on individual characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1.5:PROBLEM STATEMENT**\n",
    "Vaccines are critical for preventing communicable diseases such as COVID-19, swine flu, seasonal influenza, and tuberculosis. However, making data-driven decisions about vaccine distribution and delivery remains difficult. The CDC seeks to understand how individual features influence uptake of the vaccines so as to provide guidance for future public health efforts\n",

    "To predict how likely people are to get the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines.\n",

    "**1.6.2:Specific Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the distribution of the uptake of the H1N1 and seasonal vaccines\n",
    "To determine the correlation between the uptake of both vaccines\n",
    "To determine which characteristics are likely to influence one to taking a particular vaccine"
